What is string concatenation in JavaScript?
- It simply adds one or more strings to another string, usually to the end of that string.
-For example, if you want to concatenate “Hello” and “Joshua”, it becomes “Hello Joshua” by adding Joshua to the end of Hello.

Methods to concatenate strings:-
1/Using the “+” operator:
    *In JavaScript, the “+” operator can be used to add strings together.
    *You can add as many strings as you want.

2/Using the template literals (${``}):
    *The template literals is a special character in JavaScript that serves various purposes, such as multiline strings, string concatenation, etc.
    *An ES6 feature, it was introduced in 2015 and is supported in all modern browsers except Internet Explorer.
    *One major feature, “variable substitution”, allows JavaScript string concatenation.

3/Using the concat() method:
    *concat() is a built-in method that combines strings in JS.
    *It adds the new string to the old string and returns the overall string.

4/Using array.join() method:
    *This will concatenate all the values in an array and return a new string from an array, which by default is separated by a comma.
    *You can use other string parameters or separators to join the string together.



parseInt():
The parseInt() function parses a string argument and returns an integer of the specified radix.


*You can find examples in "script.js" file
